# Yoga Suggestion RAG App

A smart Yoga assistant that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, context-aware yoga recommendations. It combines local embeddings, a vector database, and the Google Gemini AI model to answer your yoga-related queries safely and effectively.

## Features

- **Smart Suggestions:** Ask any yoga question and get AI-generated answers based on curated yoga knowledge.
- **RAG Architecture:** Uses **Pinecone** for vector storage and **Xenova/transformers** for high-performance local embeddings to retrieve relevant context.
- **Gemini AI Integration:** Powered by Google's **Gemini Flash** (`gemini-flash-latest`) model for fast and natural language generation.
- **Safety First:** Includes a custom **Safety Service** that detects and blocks inappropriate or medical-related queries (e.g., "pregnancy", "injury") using keyword and fuzzy matching.
- **Feedback System:** Tracks user interactions and feedback (thumbs up/down) to monitor answer quality.
- **Modern UI:** Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, featuring a clean, responsive design with dark mode support and smooth animations.
- **Source Citations:** Answers strictly cite sources from the internal knowledge base for credibility.
